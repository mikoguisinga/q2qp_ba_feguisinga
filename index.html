                <p> Initially, COSE was called the “Coalition of Services for the Elderly.” However, as time passed by, only one lead organization has remained and continued the functions of COSE. The name was later on changed to Coalition of Services of the Elderly, as we would like to highlight the practice or culture of working with beneficiaries – the older persons, rather than FOR older persons, which implies that beneficiaries are mere recipients of support.
                    COSE considers older women and men as partners in the development of a better society for all ages or where older persons can live with dignity and security. Thus, we highlight the formation or strengthening of Older Person Organizations (OPOs) in whatever programs or projects we implement. Also, we always aim to enhance the capacity – knowledge, skills, and attitude of older persons so they can develop and lead their own programs, which we call the Community-Based Programs of the Elderly (CBPE).
