            The aging population of the Philippines is expected to reach 14.3 million by 2040. Older and vulnerable Filipino people face major challenges like poverty and access to health care. COSE is working to address and improve older people’s health, and help health providers face the challenges of ageing Philippines through providing access to health centers and medical assistance. Mustering strength and confidence from the experience with organizing Confederation of Older Persons Association of the Philippines (COPAP), COSE also continues to work towards national movement of older persons. Here are their current and future goals towards the betterment of older people:
            To strengthen older persons’ organizations (OPOs) through capacity development.
            To advance the well-being of older persons through networking and partnership building with various stakeholders at the local, national, regional, and international levels.
            To foster a national movement of older persons that will take the lead in promoting intergenerational solidarity and gender equality.
